# Intersection-of-2-sorted-Arrays-in-linear-time
Intersection of 2 sorted Arrays in linear time


This program finds the intersection of 2 sorted arrays .
This uses a technique which is quite similar to merge sort.
The time complexity of this functionin is O(m+n) as in the  worst case,
we will have to travserse both the sorted arrays.
